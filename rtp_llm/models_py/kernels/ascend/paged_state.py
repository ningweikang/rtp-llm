"""Device-side paged-state helpers shared by the GDN AscendC kernels.

Plan C (single-consumer path): eager decode and aclgraph capture run the same
fla_npu AscendC operators with device-tensor metadata.  These helpers replace
the former host-side metadata computation (``block_map.cpu().tolist()``) with
plain device ops so the whole decode step is capturable without any D2H
synchronisation:

* ``decode_state_indices`` gathers the read/write state pages from the block
  map — semantics identical to ``recurrent._resolve_state_pages``:
      read  page = block_map[b, max(len - 2, 0) // page]
      write page = block_map[b, (len - 1) // page]
  where ``len`` is ``sequence_lengths_plus_1``.
* ``seed_state_segment`` migrates the segment owned by ``seg_view`` (the ssm
  or conv slice of a page) from the read page to the write page when a block
  boundary is crossed.  The sibling segment of the destination page is left
  untouched — the other GDN operator owns it.

The pool views come from ``utils/typed_storage_view``: every page row packs
the ssm segment followed by the conv segment, so both segments are strided
views over one storage.

Perf constraints (measured on Ascend950PR / CANN 9.2.2, see the acl-graph
GDN performance notes):

* never ``index_select`` the 4D strided pool view directly — it degrades to
  element-wise copies (~3.8 ms); the 2D page-row view below keeps copies
  block-level (~0.04 ms);
* never assign into a mid-row slice (``row[:, off:off+len] = x``) — it lowers
  to aclnnInplaceCopy_Slice (element-wise again, ~5.9 ms); rebuild rows with
  ``torch.cat`` instead.
